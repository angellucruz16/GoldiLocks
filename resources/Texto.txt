In a pretty little house in a large forest
a long time ago
there lived tree bears
Father Bear
Mother Bear
and Baby Bear
One day the bear's breakfast porridge was so hot
that they went for a walk while it cooled
At the same time a little girl named Goldilocks
went for a walk also
and she saw the hause
Goldilocks peeped through the keuhole
but could not see very much
wich made her all the more curious to see what was inside the big house
and she wondered who could live there
She went inside and saw three delicius soups and decided to eat one
The big soup was too hot
the medium soup was too cold
but the small soup was perfect for her
then she saw a beautyfull windmill and wondered who could live in there
She looked through the window
to see the wonderfull forest before deciding to go
